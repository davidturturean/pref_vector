# Minimal dependencies for Ollama-based cross-model preference vector analysis
# This approach eliminates version conflicts by using Ollama for model management

# Core scientific computing - let package manager resolve compatibility
numpy  # Auto-resolve compatible version
scipy  # Auto-resolve compatible version  
scikit-learn  # Auto-resolve compatible version

# HTTP client for Ollama API
requests>=2.25.0

# Data handling and serialization
pandas>=1.3.0
datasets>=2.0.0  # For dataset loading if needed

# Visualization and plotting
matplotlib>=3.5.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
plotly>=5.0.0  # For interactive 3D visualizations

# Statistical analysis
statsmodels>=0.13.0

# Configuration and environment
python-dotenv>=0.19.0

# Logging and utilities
tqdm>=4.62.0

# Optional: Jupyter for notebooks (development only)
jupyter>=1.0.0
notebook>=6.4.0

# Optional: Testing framework
pytest>=6.2.0
pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# Note: No transformers, torch, or other heavy ML libraries needed
# All model inference handled through Ollama API
# This dramatically reduces dependency conflicts and installation complexity
